Task 2: Model Evaluation and Comparision

Name: Mymuna
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
ID: CT6WDS2451
Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Duration: November 25th, 2024 to January 10th, 2025

Overview of the Project:

Project: BIOSIGNALS ANALYSIS FOR SMOKING

1. Simple FNN



2. Deep FNN



3. CNN



Objectives:
 
• To build and compare various deep learning models for classifying individuals as smokers or non-smokers.
• To evaluate the models using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curves,
and learning curves.
• To interpret the results and provide insights into the effectiveness of the models. 

Key Activities:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Read CSV file and Visualized data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Label encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder, dropped irrelevant columns, boxplots for outlier detection, feature scaling using StandardScaler and Train-test split using train_test_split from sklearn.
3. Model Building and Training: Basic Neural Network, Deep Neural Network with Dropout and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
4. Evaluation & Visualization: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score using sklearn.metrics, ROC Curve and AUC and learning Curves for training and validation accuracy

Technologies Used:

Programmimg Language: Python
Libraries: Panda, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
